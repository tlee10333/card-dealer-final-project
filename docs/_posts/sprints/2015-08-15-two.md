## Card Dealer

For this sprint, we designed a new roller that didn’t rely on parts from the PIE studio (new wheels and DC motor), and dealt cards from underneath the deck. This card dealer also featured an adjustable 3D-printed gate and a new weight arm that uses a ball bearing at the end as a weight, similarly to the final product. We found that the 3D-printed gate was not reliable, as the edge of the print wasn’t straight. Because of this, we switched to laser-cutting various gates to be used in the card holder, with gap sizes ranging from 0.5mm to 5mm. The cards also didn’t shoot out far enough during this sprint, so we moved the roller from the center of the cards closer to the gate, and likewise moved the weight to be over the roller instead of the center of the cards.

We still struggled with dealing one card at a time, mainly because our motor ran based on time delay. Telling the motor to run for a certain amount of time would often over-deal or under-deal the amount of cards because our control system had no way of knowing if the motor had spun enough to properly eject a card. Because of this, we decided that using an encoder would allow us to more consistently deal one card.


## Pan Mechanism

To improve the pan mechanism we replaced the DC motor with a stepper motor and added the two support gears. The stepper motor worked to make the pan more precise and so did the support gears for leveling the platform. However, we ran into integration issues, specifically with where to route wires so they wouldn’t tangle as cards were dealt and the arduino interfering with the shooter wheels. To stop the tangling we planned to route the wires through a hole in the center of the platform and increase the height of the shooter legs so the shooter wheels would clear the arduino.
