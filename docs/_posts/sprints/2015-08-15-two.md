## Card Dealer

For this sprint, we designed a new roller that didn’t rely on parts from the PIE studio (new wheels and DC motor), and dealt cards from underneath the deck. This card dealer also featured an adjustable 3D-printed gate and a new weight arm that uses a ball bearing at the end as a weight, similarly to the final product. We found that the 3D-printed gate was not reliable, as the edge of the print wasn’t straight. Because of this, we switched to laser-cutting various gates to be used in the card holder, with gap sizes ranging from 0.5mm to 5mm. The cards also didn’t shoot out far enough during this sprint, so we moved the roller from the center of the cards closer to the gate, and likewise moved the weight to be over the roller instead of the center of the cards.

We still struggled with dealing one card at a time, mainly because our motor ran based on time delay. Telling the motor to run for a certain amount of time would often over-deal or under-deal the amount of cards because our control system had no way of knowing if the motor had spun enough to properly eject a card. Because of this, we decided that using an encoder would allow us to more consistently deal one card.


## Pan Mechanism

To improve the pan mechanism we replaced the DC motor with a stepper motor and added the two support gears. The stepper motor worked to make the pan more precise and so did the support gears for leveling the platform. However, we ran into integration issues, specifically with where to route wires so they wouldn’t tangle as cards were dealt and the arduino interfering with the shooter wheels. To stop the tangling we planned to route the wires through a hole in the center of the platform and increase the height of the shooter legs so the shooter wheels would clear the arduino.

## Table

The table design went through multiple iterations and design sprints before a final design was settled on and built. From the beginning, the main goals for the table were that it would:
1. Be visually appealing
2. Have the ergonomic design be specified to the teams body
3. Act as a lower set, end table, rather than a chest high, sit up table
4. Be able to integrate the automatic card dealer sleekly, easily, and effectively

In the process of creating this design, the team went through two design sprints. The first was to decide upon the overall design of the table structure and how it would integrate the card dealer. Six designs were proposed and a weighted decision matrix was created. The desire was to balance simplicity with a cool, effective design, so 5 different metrics were valued and weighted 

After an overall design was decided upon, a second sprint was done to determine another important component of the project, the aesthetics. Multiple different options were presented, covering material from hardwood to felt tops, their costs were all determined, and a final design of felt was chosen because of its sleekness, ease of assembly, and cheapness.


The design of felt on a circular table presented a unique construction challenge, as making circular designs into wood is always difficult. After doing some testing, it was found that the maximum diameter of the table would ideally be 44 inches in order for everyone to be able to reach their cards. In fabricating the circular shape, the Shop Bot CNC Mill was used to cut out concentric circles that were used in the table top, supports, and footers. These were then screwed together to form a solid top with a lip around the bottom where felt could be stretched taut and stapled.

Along with a nice felt top, the team wanted a nicer surface for the cards to fall upon, and thus a piece of plywood was coated with a cherry cerise finish in order to lend it a dark, red hue that contrasted well with the blue felt that was chosen for the table color.


After the table top was assembled, the centerpiece was attached, and the felt was stretched taut across the surface, 14in legs were attached to the bottom, making a nice end table look that is sleek, practical, and works for all players.


Once the table was built, then it had to be integrated with the card dealer. For this to be done there had to be a central column on which the card dealer could sit upon. This was fairly easy to build and fit comfortably and securely under the table, attached to the rest of the table through four arms.
