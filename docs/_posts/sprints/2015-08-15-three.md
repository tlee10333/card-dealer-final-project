## Card Dealer

We switched out our DC motor for a DC motor with an encoder during this sprint. This gave us finer control over dealing cards, allowing us to tune how much the motor spun to consistently deal one card. We found that the gate with a 1mm gap allows for cards to smoothly eject from the deck holder while preventing a second card from also slipping out. We also realized that the placement of the rubber band on the weight arm had a large impact on how consistently cards were dealt, as it would affect how much weight was actually being applied over the roller. Because of this, the final version of the deck holder has a slot that the rubber band fits into, allowing a user to consistently place the rubber band anytime they might move it (for example, when placing/removing a deck from the deck holder).

## Pan Mechanism

After drilling the center hole and elongating the shooter legs we had to figure out where to put the breadboard. We secured the bread board to the inside of the shooter legs. Finally we integrated the system into the table by securing it to a pillar to raise it to the table height and inserting it at the center of the table.
