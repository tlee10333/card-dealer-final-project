## Card Dealer

We switched out our DC motor for a DC motor with an encoder during this sprint. This gave us finer control over dealing cards, allowing us to tune how much the motor spun to consistently deal one card. We found that the gate with a 1mm gap allows for cards to smoothly eject from the deck holder while preventing a second card from also slipping out. We also realized that the placement of the rubber band on the weight arm had a large impact on how consistently cards were dealt, as it would affect how much weight was actually being applied over the roller. Because of this, the final version of the deck holder has a slot that the rubber band fits into, allowing a user to consistently place the rubber band anytime they might move it (for example, when placing/removing a deck from the deck holder).

## Pan Mechanism

After drilling the center hole and elongating the shooter legs we had to figure out where to put the breadboard. We secured the bread board to the inside of the shooter legs. Finally we integrated the system into the table by securing it to a pillar to raise it to the table height and inserting it at the center of the table.

## Table

The final table design was assembled and integrated with the mechanical and electrical systems. Along with a nice felt top, the team wanted a nicer surface for the cards to fall upon, and thus a piece of plywood was coated with a cherry cerise finish in order to lend it a dark, red hue that contrasted well with the blue felt that was chosen for the table color. After the table top was assembled, the centerpiece was attached, and the felt was stretched taut across the surface, 14in legs were attached to the bottom, making a nice end table look that is sleek, practical, and works for all players.

Once the table was built, then it had to be integrated with the card dealer. For this to be done there had to be a central column on which the card dealer could sit upon. This was fairly easy to build and fit comfortably and securely under the table, attached to the rest of the table through four arms. Finally,the felt was cleaned and paint was added to every visible surface to make the final product look nice and well integrated.
