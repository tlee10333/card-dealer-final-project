## DC Motor

The cards are dealt using a DC motor with an encoder. The encoder allows for fine-tuning. Once the motor reaches a certain number of ticks (defined by the length of a playing card, wheel diameter, the encoder itself, and a tuning factor), it stops, then reverses to catch any cards that might slip out with the one card being ejected. The speed chosen allows the cards to shoot out a good distance, while also being slow enough that the card accurately shoots out one card. Spinning the roller too fast can cause cards to stick together more, inconsistently shooting two cards out instead of one.
