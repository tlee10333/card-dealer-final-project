		<h3>Agile Scrum</h3>
		<p>
			Agile Scrum is a framework used to deliver products in a short time cycle. Before the beginning of a sprint,
			a product backlog of all tasks that need to be completed is made and assigned to individuals. During the
			duration of a sprint, which is usually a couple weeks to a month, team members complete their assigned
			tasks. At the end of each sprint, a presentation and retrospective is done.
