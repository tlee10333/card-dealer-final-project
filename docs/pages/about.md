    <div class="medium-6 columns b30">
        <p>I’m Ike Walker, an Olin Class of ‘26 Mechanical Engineer. I have a particular interest in the fabrication and assembly of mechanical systems, and I was able to bring my experience as a wood and laser shop assistant to helping design and build the central table. In the long run, I want to gear my career towards sustainable energy engineering, but a little cards on the side never hurt.

    <div class="medium-6 columns b30">
        <p>I'm Trinity Lee, a computer engineer who enjoys spending their spare time doing offensive cybersecurity and helping build electric racecars. For this project, I used my background in firmware, electrical engineering, and software for this project's firmware and electrical systems. If I'm not competing in a CTF or coding something, I'm probably going thrifting or playing card games in my free time! </p>
